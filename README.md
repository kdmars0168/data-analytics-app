## ðŸš€ How to Launch the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analytics-app.git
   cd data-analytics-app
   ```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On MacOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run database migrations** (only first time):
   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db migrate -m "Add Dataset table"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

7. **Open the app in your browser**:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

Unit tests are designed to verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, or modules in isolation without relying on a browser or UI. They are lightweight and fast to run, usually focusing on the business logic or backend code. Unit tests are commonly written using testing frameworks such as pytest and can be executed quickly to catch regressions early in the development cycle.

Selenium tests, on the other hand, automate real user interactions within a web browser to test the frontend functionality and user interface. These tests simulate actions like logging in, navigating pages, uploading files, and submitting forms, ensuring that the whole application behaves as expected from the userâ€™s perspective. While more comprehensive, Selenium tests require a configured browser environment and are slower to run compared to unit tests.
